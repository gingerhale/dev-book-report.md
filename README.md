Article Interest
- I first came across this video looking into what makes cards/elements move up on the page as you scroll down, but then stop once they hit the top and stay fixed there until you scroll back up to their original position. That is what made me look into the concept and then I found out it's all based on positioning. More specifically to my example, sticky positioning. This video ended up solving my question in an easy to understand way, while also providing lots of information about how to position and make or break your code.

Relevance
- As the video was published less than 5 years ago and I have read similar information regarding css positioning, I think it is safe to say the video is still relevant and helpful.

Credibility
- The author of the video is a youtuber specializing in making website development easy and accessible, he has nearly 1.5 million subscribers and has been posting videos for over 5 years. Although i wasn't able to find any of his credentials, with that many people watching his videos and the amount of likes and comments, I think it's safe to assume this dude knows what he is talking about
